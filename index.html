    <title>BASIC: Making Six Toast.</title>

    <p>
        Problem:<br>
        <br>
        You forgot to count the number of toast you put into there, you don't know if you put <br>
        exactly six pieces of toast into the toasters.<br>
        <br>
        Define a function that counts how many more (or less) pieces of toast you need in the <br>
        toasters. Even though you need more or less, the number will still be positive, not negative.<br>
        <br>
        Examples:<br>
        <br>
        You must return the number of toast the you need to put in (or to take out). In case of <br>
        5 you can still put 1 toast in:<br>
        <br>
        six_toast(5) == 1<br>
        And in case of 12 you need 6 toasts less (but not -6):<br>
        <br>
        six_toast(12) == 6<br>
